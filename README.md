# ongekiKT
working with Kamaitachi scores of your オンゲキ profile and displaying them

## Necessity
I was unable to find a method to export and display data from Kamaitachi for the game オンゲキ, so I created one myself

With this, you can find and calculate things like songs of the NEW rating frame and their ratings, which Kamaitachi doesn't do as of writing.

## Usage
- Requires Python 3.11.5
- Assumes data is of bright MEMORY ACT 2, NEW frame is set with this taken into account

1. Save `javascript:(function(d){if(location.origin=="https://kamai.tachi.ac"){var s=d.createElement("script");s.src="https://gist.githack.com/Tobz21/baaad8565fb8e17b45f224e4fd686324/raw/25c839245fba1595fe3175f6cf3ddb840d74bbf7/ongkTry.js";d.body.append(s);}})(document)`  as a bookmark, click it on Kamaitachi page or run it in the console when logged in on the page.

3. Download ongeki_const_all.json and ongekiscript.py to the same directory

4. Run ongekiscript.py on a terminal to get print output


## Limitations
- UNTESTED with LUNATIC difficulty.
  - No LUNATIC in my オンゲキ json currently, so I must put it there to be able to test it works
  - SHOULD only affect the NEW score categorization (see below)
- Not sure what 'is_unknown' is in the cc json. It mostly appears in the Basic and Advanced.
  - If we take it literally, it probably means they did not calculate the chart constants and just used the displayed level, as often chart constants are found by manual calculations and estimation
  - Or potentially the chart constants have no variation (similar to Arcaea cc behaviour on lower difficulty)
- Only tested on Windows

## Future Work
- Export instead of just printing at terminal
  - Potentially b30 image generation like Qman's オンゲキ does, but with the json support like their チュウニズム INT does
- Fix python script to take into account LUNATIC difficulty scores and release date 
  - For when difficulty = LUNATIC, use the lunatic added date instead of default date release
- Take into account and display more metrics, maybe in a nice way like how beerpsi's chuni bot shows judgements
  - Maybe make an equivalent ongeki bot with a kamaitachi hook to profile ???
- Support オンゲキ bright MEMORY ACT 3 when it releases for my cab on MYT
- Test on Linux/Unix based systems and ensure cross platform (especially with root directory)

## Acknowledgements
- beer-psi for their bookmarklet script which this one is heavily based off of
- キューマン・エノビクト (Qman / reiwa.f5.si ) for their build of オンゲキ chart constant json and b30 gen site
- wikiwiki.jp for their detailed explanation of オンゲキ rating system components
